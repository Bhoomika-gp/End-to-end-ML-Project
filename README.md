# End-to-end-ML-Project

## Introduction:
The Red Wine Quality Classification Project is a data analysis and machine learning project that aims to predict the quality of red wines based on various physicochemical properties. This project utilizes a dataset available on Kaggle, which contains information about red wine samples and their respective quality ratings.

## Dataset Overview:
The dataset used in this project comprises several attributes that describe the chemical composition and characteristics of red wines. These attributes include parameters such as alcohol content, acidity levels, residual sugar, pH, and more. Each wine sample in the dataset is assigned a quality rating, typically on a scale from 3 to 8, where higher values indicate better quality.


## Workflows

1. update config.yaml
2. update schema.yaml     
3. update params.yaml
4. update the entity 
5. update the configuration manager in src config
6. update the components
7. update the pipeline (integrating training & prediction pipeline)
8. update the main.py  (to start entire pipeline)
9. update the app.py (to create web app)
